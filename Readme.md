###### A game development Event for Udyam 2017,
###### Department of Electronics Engineering,
###### IIT (BHU) Varanasi, 221005

### Overview
Game development is one of the most interesting domains of Computer Programming. It requires substantial skill in software engineering as well as specialization in one or more of the following areas, which overlap heavily to create a game:   

* Simulation
* Computer Graphics 
* Artificial Intelligence 
* Physics
* Audio Programming 
* Input
* Object Oriented Programming
* Version Control System  

Since, we don’t have any mainstream event based on Game development, we plan to introduce it for the first time in our institute via Udyam. The event is sure to attract great amount of participation as it aims to break the usual mainstream stereotype, that “programming is all about whose code runs faster”. Students can display their creativity in a lot of ways, like making graphics for the game, programming its logic, making sound effects, etc. The best thing about the event is that it is a Platform and Language independent event. The event will surely help students develop sound programming skills which will benificial for them in future. It will give them exposure to several new tools, frameworks, programming language and help them create and model real world puzzles and problems. 


### Event Description
The planned event is supposed to have 2 rounds.   
Students can participate in teams having maximum 3 members.  

#### 1st Round
This is supposed to be an ‘on the spot’ event. A problem statement will be given to the students, to design the logic for a game, consisting of several twists and turns.  
The participants must submit the idea of their final game. 

##### Problem Statement : To be given on the spot 
##### Time Limit : 3 hrs
##### Programming Language : C#/C++/Java/Python/C
##### Venue : To be decided later

#### Final Round
Final round is an online submission round, where students have to submit their games online, via Github. To counter plaigrism, we might add a presentation round where students will have to present and explain their game 

##### Problem Statement : 
Design a game of your choice! The game can be designed using any platform or programming language. The final submission has to be done through Github.   
The final submission must include :   
1. Entire source code of the game  
2. Few screenshots of the gameplay  
3. A README file which should have :  
   * Name of the team
   * Details of the Team members
   * Details of the Tools, Frameworks and Programming Languages used
   * Brief description of the game
   * Steps on how to build and run the game through the source code

##### Restrictions : 
Since this is a programming event, softwares and frameworks like Scratch, RPG maker, etc are not allowed. The game must involve some sort of programming.

##### Time Limit : indefinite
##### Venue : No specific venue
